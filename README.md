The analysis performs a head-to-head, referee-fair comparison of four models for describing galactic rotation curves on the SPARC dataset (175 galaxies).

## Models Compared

The comparison includes four models with strictly controlled parameter budgets:

* **M0: EBC (2 params)**: A simple entropy-inspired power law, $V(r) = Ar^{\alpha}$.
* **M1: Baryons + EBC (2 params)**: A composite model where the EBC component accounts for the missing velocity after considering baryons, $V^2(r) = V_{\text{bar}}^2(r) + (Ar^{\alpha})^2$.
* **M2: Baryons + NFW (2 params)**: The standard dark matter model, combining the baryonic component with an NFW halo.
* **M3: MOND (0 params)**: Modified Newtonian Dynamics, using the "simple" interpolation function with a fixed standard acceleration parameter $a_0$.

The comparison is run on two tracks:
* **Track A**: A purely phenomenological test where the NFW model has **no** cosmology prior.
* **Track B**: An ŒõCDM-anchored test where the NFW model is constrained by the **Dutton‚ÄìMacci√≤ (2014) concentration-mass relation prior**.

## Key Results

Out of 175 galaxies, 165 passed quality control (‚â•6 usable data points per curve). The winning model for each galaxy was determined using the Bayesian Information Criterion (BIC).

| Track                   | M0 (EBC) Wins | M1 (Bar+EBC) Wins | M2 (Bar+NFW) Wins | M3 (MOND) Wins |
| ----------------------- | :-----------: | :---------------: | :---------------: | :------------: |
| **A (no NFW prior)** |      62       |        44         |        55         |       4        |
| **B (DM14 NFW prior)** |      62       |        66         |        33         |       4        |

## ‚öôÔ∏è Reproduction Guide

### 1. Installation

Clone this repository and install the required Python packages.

```bash
git clone [https://github.com/your-username/NeoAmorfic_EBC_IC.git](https://github.com/your-username/NeoAmorfic_EBC_IC.git)
cd NeoAmorfic_EBC_IC
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

2. Data Setup

The analysis relies on the SPARC galaxy data.

Download the Data: Download the 175 _rotmod.csv files from the official SPARC website.

Place the Data: Move all 175 CSV files into the rc_parsed/ directory in this repository.

Verify Integrity (Optional): Run the following command to ensure all files are correct and match the versions used in the paper.

sha256sum -c rc_parsed/sha256s.txt

3. Running the Analysis

A single script is provided to run both tracks and generate all figures and tables.

3. Running the Analysis

A single script is provided to run both tracks and generate all figures and tables.

This script will execute the main analysis script (scripts/ebc_ic_referee.py) for both Track A and Track B, followed by the plotting scripts to generate all figures. It will take some time to complete.

(For advanced use, the individual commands can be found inside the run_all.sh script.)
